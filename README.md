## RealisticCraft
RealisticCraft is a Fabric modpack that brings realism to Minecraft, without drastically changing much of the underlying gameplay.

It features:
- Atmospheric sound design
- Realistic game progression
- Many visual improvements
- A thirst and warmth system
- Redesigned combat mechanics
- Patches to unrealistic behaviour
- Many, many performance mods

It is currently in development, and most likely has some issues present. It is also not designed for multiplayer at the moment, so it may or may not work flawlessly. However, I am now actively developing this project again, so feel free to provide any criticisms you have.
